# openjdk-16-jre
Hello, I make docker for new versions JDK, because pterodactyl doesn't have official docker image for openjdk last versions, and I make custom docker image for everyone.
(I doesn't have any complaints for using my dockers for public, so fell free)
Check out my other brancher with other versions.
